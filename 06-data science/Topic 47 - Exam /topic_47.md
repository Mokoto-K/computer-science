## Exam Format

* The final exam for COSC102 will be a timed, open-book, unsupervised online exam.
  * No Proctoring Service will be used.
  * You can use whatever resources you can access (including Python/Spyder/Jupyter)
  * The exam will open on the exam date (15th October, 2020) and will be open for 24 hours.
  * You will have 2 hours and 15 minutes to complete your attempt.

---

## Exam Format

* There will be a range of question types:
  * Multiple choice.
  * Short Answer.
  * Coding questions.
* The will be practical questions where you will be required to write/run code and upload the code and plots produced from the code.
* You will need to have Python/Jupyter/Spyder up and available during the exam.

## Exam Format

* I have created a sample exam for you to practice.
* This sample exam has a range of questions that reflect those that you will see in the final exam.
* **This sample exam will serve as quizzes 4 and 5 - If you submit an attempt at this sample exam, you will receive full marks for these assessment components.**
* You will not receive feedback you your question attempts.
* The sample exam is there to give you an indication of what will be in the final exam.

## Areas of Focus

* Plotting - functions to produce line and scatter plots.
  * Labels and titles.
  * Adjusting the range to create nice looking plots.
* Working with lists and NumPy arrays
  * List/Array indexing and slicing - review tutorial 1.
  * Looping through lists/arrays.
* Importing datasets - just like we did in the group assignment.

---

## Areas of Focus

* Components of the machine learning workflow (e.g. dividing data, training and assessment)
* Know the the Scikit-Learn functions to implement the various components of the workflow.
* Understand the challenges related to training ML algorithms.
* There will be questions that relate to some steps.

---

## Areas of Focus

* Understand how the main ML algorithms that we have covered work (e.g. KNN, Decision trees, Perceptron Networks etc.) 
* Understand how the dimensionality reduction algorithms can be applied.

---

## Areas of Focus

* Review the tutorials - they all have solutions.
* Be comfortable and capable with Python basics.
  * You will need to read and expand on code within the exam.
  * Have your environment up and running for the exam.

---

## Answering Exam Questions

* General Hints:
  * Put something down for each question! I can't give you marks for a blank question.
  * Read the questions carefully - not all questions ask for a coded solution, some only ask for a description.
  * Some questions may have multiple parts - answer each part for full marks.
  * Read through the whole exam first so you know what is there to complete.

## Answering Exam Questions

* Focus on the *verbs* in the questions.
* The verbs are the *'doing'* words.
  * Make sure you *do* what they refer to.
* Common verbs include:
  * Identify - Recognize and name.
  * Describe/Explain - Outline the key points of the subject.
  * Compare - Explain key similarities/differences.
  * Discuss - Points for and against.
  * Assess - Discuss the subject and come to a conclusion.
